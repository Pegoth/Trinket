These last for 60 seconds, and grant you a decent amount of strength. If there are no enemy targets within 8 yards, you do not gain the stack nor perform the counterattack.When you reach 30 stacks (i.e. every 90s minimum), these turn into  Fury of Urctos - while this is up, you heal for a relatively negligible amount every second, and deal physical damage (hello  Bloodshot) as a counterattack on your nearest target whenever you take any direct damage event, with a 0.1s internal cooldown.Yes, this is as bonkers as it sounds in Mythic+.

This is invisible in logs as it applies to the unmitigated amount, so you need a tool of some sort to \"rework\" its effective value out. It is great for very frequent, low damage hits - which melee damage in high-density dungeons fit perfectly for. Every 2.5s, the next direct damage event will remove a plate.The real value of this trinket is that every time you lose a plate, a fire laser/tornado spawns in front of you and deals uncapped, unsplit damage to anything that goes through it, and this can hit the same enemy multiple times. Since 10.2, plates that expire also cause this effect.

The beam spawns a couple yards in front, so you don't want to be inside enemies or it'll miss, but it is quite powerful.
